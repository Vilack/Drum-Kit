# Drum-Kit
This is a basic Drum Kit web application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The project uses DOM manipulation and simple JavaScript animations to simulate a virtual drum set.


## FEATURES
1) Click on the drum buttons or press the corresponding keys on your keyboard to play drum sounds.
2) Each button is associated with a unique sound using switch statements to detect key presses.
3) A short animation is triggered for each interaction to enhance the user experience.
